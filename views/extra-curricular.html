<p>I know this sounds a bit clich&eacute;d but this old saying is as true as truth can possibly be. Like most kids I have been overly enthusiastic about sports and in my years of schooling, made basketball my forte. Playing basketball brought a different kind of passion in me. Apart from teaching me team work, it taught me to remain calm and composed even during loss. My perseverance was rewarded when I was selected to play for my city team. After winning a gold medal at the State level inter-city tournament, I was included in the State team and played at the national level. My virtue as a leader came to play when I lead my school team into numerous tournaments for two consecutive years. Never in the history of my school had a student been named captain for two straight years. What I learnt from the sport, I applied in my student life and came out as a better man.</p>
